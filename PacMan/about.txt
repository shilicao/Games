Pac Man, was once called a "Puck Man" in Japan. It was originated as 
maze action video game. 
For my program, it was developed by html canvas along side with javascript
and some css for styling. This game was not perfect as it can still go far and
beyond. Few areas that can be improve for this game:
1. Design a bigger map
2. Implementation of multi-live pacman for the game.
3. Add eventlistener for the arrow keys.
